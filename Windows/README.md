The said code can be found in this GitHub-repository: https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/ ,written in Python 2; 
or in this repository: https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35 , an updated version; written in Python 3


Furthermore, the methods used in MNIST_CONVERTER was extracted from tensorflow's python.platform.mnist; which was published under the Apache License, Version 2.0:

The methods were updated to fit their purpose in this project.
Within tensorflow, the used methods are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Thus you might not be able to find them there by time you read this.
